EH2745 Computer Application In Power System

Assignment 2

The purpose of Assignment II is to use K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm to analyze a
database from a sample power system. Machine learning is implemented in the algorithm to solve this problem.

Steps Project Implementation: 
1. Import data for CSV file.
2. Initialize centroids.
3. Cluster samples of the learning set using K-means clustering algorithm.
4. Label learn set samples.
4. Classify samples of the test set using KNN (K-nearest neighbors) Algorithm.
5. Label test set samples.

This is assignment 2 using python
